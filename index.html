        Lorem Ipsum is <span class="tag warning">warning</span> simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy <span class="tag danger">danger</span>text ever <span class="label good_to_have">good to
            have</span> since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. <span class="tag ok">Ok tag</span> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
        leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. <span class="label important">important</span>It was popularised in the 1960s
        with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <span class="label not_important">Not

        of Lorem Ipsum.
