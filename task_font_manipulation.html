        <span class="first_word">My</span> name is Urano Motosu, and I am <span class="smaller">twenty-two</span> years
        old. I <span class="italic_words">love</span> <span class="bold_words">books</span>.
        I really love
        <span class="bold_words">books</span>. I <span class="italic_words">love</span>
        books <span class="italic_words">more</span>
        than I
        <span class="smaller">love</span> getting <span class="smaller">enough</span> food.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
        <span class="first_word">I</span> <span class="bigger">love</span> how the printed words let me reach out and
        touch another
        person’s ideas,
        their <span class="italic_words">fantasies</span>. My
        heart dances
        along the roads of thought laid down by the author, and I can’t help but smile. Absorbing the vast knowledge
        <span class="italic_words">contained</span> within just a single volume always leaves me feeling like I’ve grown
        as a person. The
        whole wide
        world,
        which I have never seen with my own eyes, is at my <span class="italic_words">fingertips</span>, stacked neatly
        within the shelves of
        <span class="bold_words">bookstores</span>
        and
        <span class="bigger">libraries</span>; isn’t it intoxicating? The fairy tales of foreign lands, the <span
            class="bigger">glimpses</span> of
        life in distant
        times and
        places, the reaches of every branch of history… when I absorb myself in a book, time <span
            clasgs="bold_words">evaporates</span>
        around me.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="first_word">Psychology</span>, religion, history, geography, education, folklore, mathematics,
        physics, geology,
        chemistry,
        biology,
        art, fitness, language, fiction… All of humanity’s accumulated knowledge and insight has been tightly packed
        into
        these books, and I love each of them from the bottom of my heart.
